- Could be detected by network monitoring tools
- Requires appropriate network permissions

#### File System Access:
- May trigger file system monitoring alerts
- Requires appropriate file system permissions
- Log files may contain sensitive information

### Security Features

#### Implemented:
- Process name spoofing (Linux)
- Memory footprint minimization
- Anti-debugging techniques
- Timing evasion patterns
- Resource limiting

#### Planned:
- Enhanced evasion techniques
- Better detection avoidance
- Improved stealth capabilities
- Advanced anti-analysis
